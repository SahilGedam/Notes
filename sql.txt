(DBMS)---- is a software application that interacts with the user, applications, and database to capture and analyze data.
RDBMS--a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them.

DDl-- create,alter,drop,truncate,rename
DML-- insert,update,delete
DQL- select
DCL---commit,grant,rollback,
Constraint--.
NOT NULL - Restricts NULL value from being inserted into a column.
CHECK - Verifies that all values in a field satisfy a condition.
DEFAULT - Automatically assigns a default value if no value has been specified for the field.
UNIQUE - Ensures unique values to be inserted into the field.
PRIMARY KEY - Uniquely identifies each record in a table. MUST HAVE ONE PK.
FOREIGN KEY - Ensures referential integrity for a record in another table.

INDEX - Indexes a field providing faster retrieval of records.
UNIQUE Key---is a set of one or more than one field of a table that uniquely identifies a record in a database table.it can accept only one null value and it cannot have duplicate values.
CANDIDATE keY---->A single key or a group of multiple keys that uniquely identify rows in a table. A table can have multiple Candidate keys.

Normalization ---the process of organizing data attributes with their relationships to avoid duplication and redundancy.
1NF--single-valued attribute
2NF--no partial dependency
3NF--no transitive dependency.
Denormalization ---the process of adding precomputed redundant data ,to improve read performance DB.
Atomicity--ALL /nothing transaction
Consistency--Data must be consistent after transaction
Isolation--no other process can change data while transaction
Durability--the changes made by transaction must persist.
VIEW---virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Order of clauses:FWGHSOL
--------------------------------------
SET OPRRATION--used to join the results of 2/more SELECT statements.
UNION:-------used to combine the results of 2/more SELECT Statements with Identical columns without returning any duplicate rows. should be the same number of columns.
UNION ALL---used to combine the results of two or more SELECT Statements into a single set of rows and columns without the removal of any duplicates.
INTERSECT----used to combine two SELECT statements with identical columns and returns rows only common rows returned by the two select statements.
MINUS--- combines the results of two SELECT statements and returns only those in
the final result, which belongs to the first set of the result.
--------------------------------------------
JOIN------ clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
SELF JOIN---joins data from the same table.Records taken from the table are matched to other records from the same table.
INNERJOIN--------Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables involved in the join. 
LEFT JOIN-------Retrieves all the records/rows from the left and the matched records/rows from the right table.
RIGHTJOIN--Retrieves all the records/rows from the right and the matched records/rows from the left table.
FULL JOIN--- Retrieves all the records where there is a match in either the left or right table.
----------------------------------------------
INDEX---data structure that provides a quick lookup of data in a column or columns of a table. 
SUBQUERY----- a query within another query, also known as a nested query or inner query.
WHERE clause--- used to filter records that are necessary, based on specific conditions.
ORDER BY---- used to sort the records based on some fieldS in ascending (ASC) /(DESC).
GROUP BY ---- used to group records with identical data & to produce summarized results from DB.
HAVING --- used to filter records in combination with the GROUP BY clause. 
WHERE clause--- cannot filter aggregated records.
--------------------------------------------
Data Integrity-- the assurance of accuracy and consistency.
DELETE -- used to delete rows from a table.
TRUNCATE--used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table.
DROP --used to remove an object from the database.table structure is removed from the database. 
stored procedure ---------is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.
trigger---- is a database object that is associated with a table and automatically executes a set of SQL statements when a specific event occurs on that table
